# Between-Two-Sets
Between two sets is a problem on hacker rank web site i think it's a good problem 
the description :_
At first of all besm ellah el rahman el rahem 
we assigned the values of the size of the first array - Smaller in value - and the size of the second array a - bigger in value-
then i started testing with the last value in the smaller array as the last value is the 
bigger one the process of testin is { to test the counter with all values of the smaller array and if the modulus equal zero then indecator of the first array incremnted by one then check if the onesindecator equal the size of array as indection to that all elements is able to be divided on all elements .
if false then skip the chick of the second array .
But if true then check with the bigger array if true also the final indecator is incremented 
then try with a nother iterator 
don't forget to assign the ones and seconds indecator with zeros in each cycle to compare with a true value
